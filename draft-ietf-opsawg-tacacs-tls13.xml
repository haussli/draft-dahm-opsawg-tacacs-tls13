            <t>
                The Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) protocol provides device
                administration for routers, network access servers, and other networked computing devices via one or more
                centralized TACACS+ servers.
                This document adds Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3) support to TACACS+ and obsoletes former inferior
                security mechanisms.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                The <xref target="RFC8907">Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) Protocol
            </xref> provides device administration for routers, network access servers, and other networked computing
                devices via one or more centralized TACACS+ servers.
                The protocol provides authentication, authorization and accounting services (AAA) for TACACS+ clients
                within the device administration use case.
            </t>
            <t>
                While the content of the protocol is highly sensitive, TACACS+ lacks effective confidentiality,
                integrity, and authentication of the connection and network traffic between the TACACS+ server and client,
                requiring secure transport to safeguard a deployment.
                The security mechanisms as described in Section 10 of <xref target="RFC8907"/> are extremely weak.
            </t>
            <t>
                To address these deficiencies, this document updates the TACACS+ protocol to use <xref target="RFC8446">
                TLS 1.3
            </xref> authentication and encryption, and obsoletes the use of TACACS+ obfuscation mechanisms (Section 10.5 of <xref
                    target="RFC8907"/>).
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Technical Definitions" anchor="TLSTacacsServerDefinition">
            <t>
                The terms defined in Section 3 of
                <xref target="RFC8907"/>
                are fully applicable here and will not be repeated.
                The following terms are also used in this document.
            </t>
                <t>
                    Obfuscation: TACACS+ was originally intended to incorporate a mechanism for securing the body of its packets.
                    The algorithm is categorized as Obfuscation in <xref target="RFC8907" section="10.5.2"/>. The term
                    is used to ensure that the algorithm is not mistaken for encryption. It should not be considered secure.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Non-TLS connection: This term refers to the connection defined in <xref target="RFC8907"/>.
                    It is a connection without TLS, using the unsecure TACACS+
                    authentication and obfuscation (or the unobfuscated option for test).
                    The use of well-known TCP/IP host port number 49 is specified as the default for Non-TLS
                    connections.
                </t>
                <t>
                    TLS connection: A TLS connection is a TCP/IP connection with TLS authentication and encryption used by TACACS+ for
                    transport. A TLS connection for TACACS+ is always between one TACACS+ client and one TACACS+ server.
                </t>
                <t>
                    TLS TACACS+ server: This document describes a variant of the TACACS+ server, introduced in Section 3.2 of [RFC8907],  which
                    utilizes TLS for transport, and makes some associated protocol optimizations. Both server variants respond to
                    TACACS+ traffic, but this document specifically defines a TACACS+ server (whether TLS or Non-TLS) as being bound to specific port number
                    on a particular IP address or hostname. This definition is important in the context of the configuration
                    of TACACS+ clients, to ensure they direct their traffic to the correct TACACS+ servers.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Peer: The peer of a TACACS+ client (or server) in the context of a TACACS+ connection, is a TACACS+ server (or
                    client). Together, the ends of a TACACS+ connection are referred to as peers.
                </t>
        </section>

        <section title="TACACS+ over TLS">
            <t>
                TACACS+ over TLS takes the protocol defined in <xref target="RFC8907"/>, removes the option for MD5
                obfuscation, and specifies that TLS 1.3 be used for transport (<xref target="TLSPort"/> elaborates TLS version support). A new well-known default host port number is used.
                The next sections provide further details and guidance.
            </t>
            <t>TLS is introduced into TACACS+ to fulfill the following requirements:
            </t>
            <ol>
                <li>Confidentiality and Integrity: The MD5 algorithm underlying the obfuscation mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC8907"/> has been shown
                    to be insecure <xref target="RFC6151"/> when used for encryption. This prevents TACACS+ being used in a <xref target="FIPS-140-3"/> - compliant deployment. Securing TACACS+ protocol with TLS is intended to provide confidentiality and
                    integrity without requiring the provision of a secured network.
                </li>
                <li>Peer authentication: The authentication capabilities of TLS replace the shared secrets of obfuscation for mutual authentication.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <t>This document adheres to the recommendations in [I-D.ietf-uta-require-tls13].</t>
            <section title="Separating TLS Connections" anchor="TLSPort">
                <t>
                    All data exchanged by TACACS+ peers MUST be encrypted, including the mutual
                    authentication of the peers. Therefore, when a TCP connection is
                    established for the service, a TLS handshake begins immediately.
                </t>
                <t>
                    To ensure separation of TACACS+ traffic that uses TLS from that which does not (<xref
                        target="wellknown"/>), TLS TACACS+ servers MUST be deployed on a separate TCP/IP port number from Non-TLS TACACS+ servers (preferably on a separate host, as recommended in <xref target="TLSUSE"/>).
                    Because of the widespread use of default port number
                    settings in numerous existing TACACS+ client configurations, a well-known system TCP/IP port number is assigned: the designated port
                    number is <xref target="ICTBD">[TBD]</xref> with the service name <xref target="ICTBD">tacacss</xref>.
                    This ensures that the client can separate TLS and Non-TLS traffic even where default port numbers are omitted from its TACACS+ server connection
                    configuration.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Under exceptional circumstances, this document permits any other TCP port number to be configured
                    when
                    required by deployment specifics, but the implications in <xref target="wellknown"/> have to be considered by operators.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="TLS Connection" anchor="TLSConn">
                <t>
                    A TACACS+ client initiates a TLS connection by making a TCP connection to a configured TLS TACACS+ server on the
                    TACACS+ TLS port number.
                    Once the TCP connection is established, the client MUST immediately begin the TLS negotiation before
                    sending any TACACS+ protocol data.
                </t>
                <t>
                    <xref target="RFC8446">TLS 1.3</xref>
                    must be used for transport, though it is expected that TACACS+ as described in this document will
                    work
                    with future versions of TLS. Earlier versions of TLS MUST NOT be used.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Once the TLS connection is established, the exchange of TACACS+ data proceeds as defined in <xref
                        target="RFC8907"/>, except that it is transmitted over TLS as TLS application data and without
                    TACACS+ obfuscation (<xref target="ObsolescenceOfTACACSObfuscation"/>).</t>
                <t>
                    The connection persists until the TLS TACACS+ peer closes it, either due to an error, or at the
                    conclusion of the TACACS+ session, or, if Single Connection Mode (<xref target="RFC8907" section="4.3"/>)
                    has been negotiated, when an inactivity timeout occurs.
                    Why it closed has no bearing on TLS resumption, unless closed by a TLS error, in which case the
                    ticket
                    might be invalidated.
                </t>
                <t>
                    TACACS+ connections are not long-lived. Non 'Single Connection Mode' (<xref target="RFC8907" section="4.3"/>) connections are closed as soon as the TACACS+ session completes. Single Connection Mode connections are longer lived, but even these are timed out and closed after a short period of inactivity. For this reason, keepalives are not required to be supported.
                </t>
                <t>
                    TACACS+ clients and servers widely support IPv6 configuration in addition to IPv4. This document makes no changes to recommendations in this area.
                </t>

            <section title="TLS Authentication Options">
                <t>
                    Implementations MUST support certificate-based mutual authentication, to provide a core option for interoperability between deployments.

                <t>Deploying TLS certificate-based uthentication correctly will considerably improve the security of TACACS+
                    deployments. It is essential for implementers and operators to understand the implications of a TLS

                    The TLS Resumption protocol, detailed in <xref target="RFC8446"/>, can minimize the number of round trips required during the handshake process.
                    If a TLS client holds a ticket previously extracted from a NewSessionTicket message from the TLS TACACS+ server, it can use the PSK identity tied to that ticket.
                    If the TLS TACACS+ server consents, the resumed session is acknowledged as authenticated and securely linked to
                    the initial session.
                </t>
                <t>The client SHOULD use resumption when it holds a valid unused ticket from the TLS TACACS+ server,
                    as each ticket is intended for a single use only and will be refreshed during resumption. The TLS TACACS+ server can reject a resumption request,
                    but the TLS TACACS+ server SHOULD allow resumption if the ticket in question has not expired and has not been used before.

                  <t>
                    When a TLS TACACS+ server is presented with a resumption request from the TLS client, it MAY still choose to require a full handshake.
                    In this case, the negotiation proceeds as if the session was a new authentication,
                    and the resumption attempt is ignored.  As described in <xref target="RFC8446" section="C.4"/>, reuse of a ticket allows passive observers to correlate
                    different connections. TLS TACACS+ clients and servers SHOULD follow the client tracking preventions in <xref target="RFC8446" section="C.4"/>.

                <ul>
                    <li>for Non-TLS connection TACACS+: Port number 49.</li>
                    <li>for TLS connection TACACS+: (TBD).</li>
                </ul>
                <t>
                    Implementors may offer a single option for TACACS+ clients and servers to disable all
                    Non-TLS TACACS+ operations. When enabled on a TACACS+ server, it will
                    not respond to any requests from Non-TLS TACACS+ client connections. When enabled on
                    a TACACS+ client, it will not establish any Non-TLS TACACS+ server connections.

                <t>
                    A new port number is considered appropriate and superior to a "STARTTLS" command or other negotiation
                    method because it allows:
                </t>
                <ul>
                    <li>ease of blocking the unobfuscated or obfuscated connections by the TCP/IP port number,</li>
                    <li>passive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) monitoring the unobfuscated to be unaffected by the
                        introduction of TLS,
                    </li>
                    <li>avoidance of Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks that can interfere with STARTTLS,</li>
                    <li>prevention of the accidental exposure of sensitive information due to misconfiguration.</li>
                </ul>
                <t>
                    However, co-existence of inferior authentication and obfuscated, whether a Non-TLS connection or
                    deprecated parts that compose TLS, also presents opportunity for down-grade attacks.
                    Causing failure of connections to the TLS-enabled service or the negotiation of shared algorithm
                    support are two such down-grade attacks.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The simplest mitigation exposure from Non-TLS connection methods is to refuse Non-TLS
                    connections at the host entirely, perhaps using separate hosts for Non-TLS connections and TLS.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Another approach is mutual configuration that requires TLS.
                    TACACS+ clients and servers SHOULD support configuration that requires peers, globally and individually, use
                    TLS.
                    Furthermore, peers SHOULD be configurable to limit offered or recognized TLS versions and algorithms
                    to those recommended by standards bodies and implementers.

                Operational and deployment considerations are spread throughout the
                document. While avoiding repetition, it is useful for the impatient
                to direct particular attention to Sections 5.2 and 5.1.5.
                However, it is important that the entire Section 5 is observed.

            <section title="Migration" anchor="MIGRATION">
                <t>
                    Section 5.2 mentions that for an optimal deployment of TLS TACACS+,
                    TLS should be universally applied throughout the deployment. However, during
                    the migration process from a Non-TLS TACACS+ deployment, operators may need
                    to support both TLS and Non-TLS TACACS+ servers. This migration phase allows
                    operators to gradually transition their deployments from an insecure state to
                    a more secure one, but it is important to note that it is vulnerable to
                    downgrade attacks. Therefore, the migration phase should be considered
                    insecure until it is fully completed. To mitigate this hazard:
                </t>
                <ul>
                    <li>The period where any client is configured with both TLS and Non-TLS TACACS+ servers should be
                        minimized.
                    </li>
                    <li>The operator must consider the impact of mixed TLS and Non-TLS on security, as mentioned above.</li>

                            <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) are used to
                                protect data exchanged over a wide range of application protocols and can also form the
                                basis for secure transport protocols. Over the years, the industry has witnessed several
                                serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly used cipher
                                suites and their modes of operation. This document provides the latest recommendations
                                for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. These
                                recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.

                            <t>RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published when the industry
                                was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is largely complete, and TLS
                                1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the new environment
                                and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of
                                recent attacks.
